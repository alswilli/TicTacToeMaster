then make sure you have a remote in your repo to the existing
tic-tac-toe-master website, with the foloowing command.

    heroku git:remote -a tic-tac-toe-master

----Structure of Game Code----

In the index.html, there are multiple javascript sources in the body, these are
the files that run the tictactoe game. Each file, except for game.js, is a different 
state of the game, i.e menu, win, etc.

game.js initializes the game object and loads all of these states to the game object.
First, loadState loads the imgs, then the menuState is displayed. When the user clicks
the screen, ticTacState starts, which is the actual game. From there, when the game ends
winState is displayed, which can then restart ticTacState once the user clicks the screen
again.
